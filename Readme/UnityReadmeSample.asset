      in asset format to the project and scene objects.\n\nThis is intended to improve
      communication with the team working on the project and also to allow other
      team members who are not actively linked to the script but rather activities
      directly linked in the editor, such as Level-Designers, to help document the
      project and the components that it uses.\n\nIn addition to helping to create
      visual points of interest through the hierarchy of unity.\r"
